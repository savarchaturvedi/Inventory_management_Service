**As a** [Product Manager]
**I need** [ the ability to update product functions]  
**So that** [I can change the product name, description, price, and stock]  
   
 ### Details and Assumptions
* The product should allow for seamless updates to critical fields (name, description, price, stock).
* The update function should include validation (e.g., price cannot be negative, stock must be an integer).
* The changes should be reflected in real-time on the product listing page.

 ### Acceptance Criteria  
   
```gherkin
Given a product exists in the system
When I edit the product name, description, price, or stock
Then the updated values are saved and displayed correctly
```
